cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_19_patch2
cd CMSSW_10_6_19_patch2/src
cmsenv
git cms-init   #not really needed unless you later want to add some other cmssw stuff
git clone https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/nanoAOD-tools.git PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools
scram b

2) copy 
 /cms/evah/workspace/CMSSW_10_6_19_patch2/src/PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/python/postprocessing/modules/jme/fatJetUncertainties.py
to the same place in your area
I modified this code so that it takes care of the name of the fatjetcollection and so that it does the jet-subjet matching that we want
and modified the groomed subjets to use the matched subjets

3) make a condor job that runs
makepico_data.sh
OR
makepico_MC.sh
depending on if you are running over data or MC
(this runs MakePico.sh, which runs preprocess.py )

4) mkdir gobetween

5) make sure to modify the triglist files

6) check that the keepfile.txt has EVERYTHING  you need.
